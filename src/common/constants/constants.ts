  2: "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this information. This is very concerning, and I want to make sure Sarah and everyone involved are safe. Could you clarify if Tyler is a student at the same school, or if he's coming from outside the campus?",
  "2reply": "No, he doesn't go to the school. He just shows up when he knows Sarah will be there.",
  3: "I see, thank you for letting us know. It's important that the school and authorities are made aware of this. Has Sarah or her friends reported any of this to a teacher or administrator?",
  "3reply": "No, Sarah is too scared to say anything, and her friends don't want to get involved because of his threats.",
  4: "<strong>@invite</strong> Hi, this is Ellie from the Crisis Center. I‚Äôm currently handling an anonymous tip regarding a serious situation involving Sarah, an 11th-grade student, and an individual named Tyler, who‚Äôs reportedly abusive and making threats.",
  "4reply": "I‚Äôm following along. From what I‚Äôve seen in the tip so far, we‚Äôll immediately alert campus security to watch for unauthorized visitors. I‚Äôll also inform Coach Johnson to pull Emmitt aside for a conversation. If you‚Äôre able to get images or any additional information, let me know. We‚Äôll prepare to escalate this to law enforcement if necessary.",
  "4sum": "Tyler, who is not a student, is abusive toward his girlfriend Sarah, an 11th grader, and stalks her on campus, threatening harm to her and her friends to keep them silent. Coach Johnson and administration are advised to speak with Sarah‚Äôs best friend, Emmitt, for more information.",
  5: "Understood. I‚Äôll ask the tipster if they can safely provide any evidence, such as images of bruises or marks.",
  "5reply": "I‚Äôll also make sure Sarah is discreetly checked on. <strong>@Diana-Thompson</strong> Please connect with Sarah during a neutral moment to avoid raising suspicion.",
  "5reply2": "Yes. Checking her schedule now and will follow-up.",
  6: "Understood. Sarah's safety is a priority, and it's critical that this is addressed quickly. I will notify the appropriate school officials, including Coach Johnson, as you suggested, so they can speak with Emmitt.\n\nDo you know if Sarah has been physically harmed, or if she's mentioned feeling in immediate danger?",
  "6reply": "I think he's hit her before, but I don't know for sure. She doesn't really talk about it, but she always seems scared.",
  7: "That's very concerning. If you happen to have or can safely obtain any images of bruises or marks that Sarah might have from physical abuse, uploading those could be very helpful in providing evidence to ensure she gets the proper support and protection.",
  "7reply": "I think one of her friends took a picture of a bruise on Sarah's arm a while ago, but I'll have to ask them.",
  "7reply2": "If it's safe for you to provide images, it could be very helpful for the authorities or school to take this seriously and act quickly. However, please don't put yourself or anyone else in danger trying to get it.\n\nIf you're able to upload it here, we can ensure it's handled confidentially and used to protect Sarah.",
  8: "Thank you. The tipster has also mentioned that Tyler is actively threatening Sarah‚Äôs friends. I suggest including that in your outreach to Emmitt‚Äîhe may be afraid to speak up as well.",
  "8reply": "Already noted. I‚Äôll ensure Coach Johnson reassures Emmitt that his safety is a priority and that the school will protect him if he chooses to come forward.",
  9: "Thank you. Please stay safe. The information you've provided is incredibly valuable, and we'll act on it. Let us know if there's anything else you think we should know.",
  "9reply": "Alright, I'll try. Thanks for helping.",
  "9reply2": "You're welcome. You're making a big difference by speaking up. Reach out anytime."
